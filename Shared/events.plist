            <string>Technically the first day of summer is June 21. But we’re annexing June 20 in this instance, since today is the nation’s biggest art parade, the Coney Island Mermaid Parade. How could you not, when it means thousands of people walking through the streets of Coney Island in elaborate costumes and on floats. Gather a group, dress to shock and roll up next to your fellow rainbow wing-clad, blue paint-covered sea fanatics. Just don’t go wandering off if you hear siren songs; The Odyssey tells us that’s not such a good idea.</string>

            <string>Second day of summer! How about you visit Staten Island? You scoff, sure, but it’s not just any Staten Island. Today, SI has been taken over by punks! Punk Island is a free all-day music festival where you can see such bands as Cookie Deficiency, Princess Tiny and The Meats, The Sex Zombies and Wombat in Combat. FREE, just like the ferry to get you there. So bring plenty of water, buy some merch, and let your inner punk roar.</string>

            <string>Four writers enter! Four writers also leave, but not without having their work judged by professionals. Literary Death Match will be taking place at The Bell House. For just a measly $10, you can witness dreams of literary glory get crushed, lightly criticized or even lauded. Four writers get seven minutes each to sell the judges on their work. Then out of the four, two are chosen for a Death Match. It’s the only Literary Death Match taking place in Brooklyn this summer, so for the bookworms out there, this is your chance to show your friends you have a functioning social life, too!</string>

            <string>One of the most important skills in anyone’s social repertoire is the ability to dance. Dancing makes you instantly more attractive to the people you’re trying to seduce, and can also impress the people who are trying to seduce you but secretly think you can’t dance. In short, learn to dance. Where? Why, at the Lincoln Center Midsummer Night Swing, of course. Dance lessons, live music and even some BBQ afterwards.</string>

            <string>Visiting a cemetery at night is the best way to get spooked (and even have fun doing it). And if you’ve never visited the Greenwood Cemetery before, it’s going to be especially well-haunted this summer. In celebration of the 150th anniversary of “Alice in Wonderland,” the cemetery handpicked visual artists to turn the cemetery into a modern version of Wonderland called Dark Wonderland, ooooh. So take a step through the looking glass; we guarantee you’ll sleep with one eye open afterwards.</string>

            <string>Museums can be quite pricey. Also because of rules, and because some of the works are priceless you can’t really touch the art in fear of getting in trouble and/or banned from a museum for life. In Jeppe Hein’s public art project at Brooklyn Bridge Park, “Please Touch The Art,” you are actually encouraged to interact with the installations Hein has left around the park. You can sit, climb, touch, and experience these colorful, and interactive works of public art all summer. We recommend the “Appearing Rooms”</string>

The plot? A NYC cop has to deal with a serial killer and a winged serpent grabbing the city’s rooftop sunbathers. Be cautious the next time you attend a rooftop party or just laugh while you drink at this one-star classic.</string>

            <string>Not everyone these days has some sort of super expensive game system in their living rooms. We still love playing games, but there like $60 bucks and you rather spend it on alcohol, like a real adult. So to have yourself a few drinks, plus relive the good old days when you could assert your video game dominance in person, you can head to Barcade and play classic arcade titles like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles game, WWF Superstars, Metal Slug, Joust and more.</string>
